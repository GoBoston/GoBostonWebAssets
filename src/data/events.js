      details: `Alexandria Nunweiler with collaborative dance company The Click presents a new dance/theater work “Edge of Aquarius.”`,
      info: "The performance takes inspiration from the surprisingly strange phenomenon of birthdays – the rituals surrounding them, the odd bonds people have with others who share theirs, the increasing malaise about them as people age, and the rites of passage and physical milestones they represent. Several years in the back of her mind as an idea, Nunweiler was compelled to create the work when iconic actress Betty White died just shy of her 100th birthday. (She and White shared a January 17 birthday.) Interwoven with personal stories from performers, fun and irreverent props, and fascinating birthday lore, this piece takes a microscope to aging and the way we celebrate and commemorate milestones. Cake is involved."
